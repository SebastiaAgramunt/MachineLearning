# Autoencoder

An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network designed to compress data and then decompress it. For instance in this example we compress MNIST images and then we reconstruct them. We will see that the reconstructed image is more noisy than the original. For further info about autoencoders, check [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder).
